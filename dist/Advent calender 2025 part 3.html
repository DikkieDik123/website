                            <p>OSINT for Fun has a great number of challenges on their website. Each challenge is usually faster to complete than the Bellingcat ones, so that's why I do multiple at a time.<br> You might notice that the progress seems slow. This is because writing it up takes much longer than completing the challenges.</p>
                            <p>This post, I'm going to show how I solved the challenges of day 9 through 12.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- challenge description-->
                        <div>
                            <h1>Day 9</h1>
                            <h2>Who said statues couldn't move?!</h2>
                            <p><figure class="figure">

                            We can hear a song. I could've Shazammed the song, but instead I Googled this sentence which one can hear: "I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone".
                            I instantly knew that this challenge was going to be about the Molly Malone statue, located in Dublin. For context, I saw it as a tourist back in 2017. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The challenge description mentions that the statue was moved, so first we need to find its original location. The <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Malone#Statue">Wikipedia page</a> for the statue mentions that it was placed at the bottom of Grafton Street, and that the statue was moved in April 2014.</p>
                            <p>Great! Now we need to see if there's some way to see what it looked like. And Google Maps, very conveniently, can help us out here!</p>
                            <p>By going to the North-end of Grafton Street in Google Street View and changing the date to June 2009, we can see the statue in its old location.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>We can see that the statue faces a pediment that says <b>IRISH PERMANENT</b>. Day 9 done!</p>

                            <p>This challenge is a bit more serious. Find the park where 19 rhinos were poached.</p> 
                            <p>First, I started to Google, simply typing: 19 rhinos killed december 2024. The first hit contained the answer: <b>Kruger</b> National Park.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            </figure>
                            <p>That's the first part of the challenge. Next, I was asked to find out how many rhinos were killed in 2017 and 2023 in the province with the most killings.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>The first step is to figure out what province we need to look into. This was once again performed by a simple Google search.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/10/Killings per province.png" alt="Google result to see the provinces with the most poachings" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Clearly, it's KwaZulu-Natal which sees the most rhino killings in South Africa. Next, I needed to find the number of killed rhinos in 2017. I used the following Google query to find the answer on Save the Rhino International's webpage: rhino killings 2017 kwazulu natal. In 2017, 222 rhinos were poached.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            </figure>
                            <p>Next, I needed to find the number of rhinos killed in 2023. I simply altered the query by replacing "2017" with "2023" and clicked on the first two hits. Both showed the same answer, namely that an estimated 325 rhinos were killed.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/10/rhino killings in 2023.png" alt="Rhino killings in 2023" class="img-fluid"/>

                            <p>The answer to the question is thus <b>222 325</b>.</p>

                            Time to hit Google once again. Time to find some old German lotto results! First, I used Google Translate before searching, as searching in the original language usually has a greater chance of success in my experience.
                        </p>

                            <p>I Googled just to make sure that the text on the bib is really the name of the race, and that was indeed the case. I can say that the actor participated in the <b>Bieg po Nowe Życie</b> race.</p>

                            <p>This was a fun challenge, and I'm glad they are getting more difficult as the days progress.</p>
                            <p>For this challenge, first, I need to know the company name. The image provided has all the company names removed, as well as the street name. But they didn't make it impossible to solve.</p>
                            <p>My initial plan of attack consisted of reverse-searching the provided image. However, it became apparent that this would not work, or if it did, I was not patient enough.</p>
                            <p>So, I went for my usual plan B: when in doubt, dork it out. I figured that if I just search for one of the slogans which are visible next to the entrance, I might find the company. And so, I did!</p>

                            <p>I ended up on a PDF that included the exact same slogan, and the company name and website. The logo matched the blurred logo in the challenge-description, so I was confident I was going in the right direction.</p>

                            <p>Visiting their <a>website</a>, we can see that they have three different offices. I picked the office in Toulouse, based on the reflection in the store windows. Then, I looked the location up on Google Maps and went into Street View. I needed to change the date to 2021 to get a good view of the shop next door.</p>

                            <p>Now, as the last step I simply typed the phone number into Google, and the first hit shows us the answer.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>To conclude: the company's legal name is <b>M.V</b>! That's all for this post, I'll be back later to solve some more challenges in the next one.</p>
