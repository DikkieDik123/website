                            <p>OSINT for Fun has a great number of challenges on their website. Each challenge is usually faster to complete than the Bellingcat ones, so that's why I do multiple at a time.</p>
                            <p>This post, I'm going to show how I solved the challenges of day 13 through 16.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- challenge description-->
                        <div>
                            <h1>Day 13</h1>
                            <h2>Locate the concert</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/13/Question.png" alt="Question of day 13" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1: Question of day 13.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>The first step is to find the news article that mentions the concert. I figured the smartest way was to dork the answer, for we have enough information to define our query well. We know the rough date, the event and the news outlet. That created the following query: inurl:lemonde.fr “concert” AND “hier”. Hier is the French word for “yesterday”, which I figured probably would be included in the article. Note that under the Tools tab, I specified the date to be between 01/06/2013 and 31/08/2013.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/13/Google dork with translated results.png" alt="Google dork with translated results" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2: Google dork with results translated from French to English</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>This resulted in five articles, of which the top three are the only relevant ones I could spot. And after reading these articles, it became clear that the article called <a href=”https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/mundolatino/2013/06/13/jimmy-cliff-reggae-night-a-rio-loco/”>Reggae Night</a> was the only article that talked about the concert in the previous day, instead of concerts or interviews that were more than one day ago, as was the case with the other articles. </p>
                            <p>The article mentions that Jimmy Cliff performed at the Rio Loco festival. Googling this name, it appears that the festival took place in the park “Prairie des Filtres” in Toulouse. That isn't accurate enough, however. </p>                            
                            <p>I went to Google Images and typed in: Rio Loco 2013. This showed a picture of the main stage with the bridge in the background. I found the location of this stage on Google maps, which is marked as Rio Loco. And this gave the correct coordinates (<b>43.59769, 1.43760</b>).</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/13/Search result for Rio Loco 2013.png" alt="Search result for Rio Loco 2013 in Google Images" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3: Search result for Rio Loco 2013 in Google Images.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            </figure>
                            <p>Then, a second question appeared. Find the photographer. This challenge was very easy and only took me a few minutes.</p> 
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/13/Question 2.png" alt="Second question of day 13" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>    
                            <p>I went to YouTube and typed in: Rio Loco 2013 programme des concerts. The first hit was sufficient, and about halfway through the video the picture we are looking for appeared. </p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/13/Jimmy Cliff photo.png" alt="Screenshot of the Youtube video of the program of the festival in 2013" class="img-fluid"/>

                            <p>Using a screenshot of this image, using Windows+Shift+S and reverse-image searching with Google resulted in many hits of where this photo was used. Again, on the first hit, the photographer was mentioned in the credits of the picture. </p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>Sofia Santos provides us with another Christmas-themed challenge: identify the airline, make and model of the aircraft seen in the picture. </p>

                            <p>The first step is to reverse-search the image. Using Google, I found a matching image from a website mentioning Airberlin, the airline we’re likely looking for. </p>

                            <p>I found this day more challenging, but ended up spending only 30 minutes or so on it. First, I went to Google Maps and went to see where the incident roughly happened. </p>

                            <p>It happened near Aden, in the Gulf of Aden. This is useful information. Next, I went to Google and executed the following query: “UKMTO” AND “Aden” AND “Incident”, filtering by dates between 01/09/2025 and 30/11/2025. Next, I unfortunately took a bit of a wrong turn.</p>

                            <p>Clicking on the first hit, it showed that an incident occurred on September 23, 2025, where the Minervagracht was attacked by an unknown actor. I found the IMO then quickly, but it was wrong. Why? In hindsight, I should've known that the CAUSE of the incident was clear, namely an attack. So, I looked further. </p>
                            <p>Going back to the Google results from my dork earlier, I found that on October 18, a vessel was hit by an unknown projectile. </p>

The rough location of the reported incident seems to match the challenge information.</p>
                            <p>Looking into the page, it is visible that this incident occurred with the Falcon, with IMO <b>9014432</b>. </p>

                            <p>The next question then popped up. Who was the commanding officer of the rescue operation?</p>

                            <p>Using the information we know, I queried Google with the following: 18 october distress signal French navy. I figured that the French aircraft most likely belonged to the navy, and if not, Google probably would pick up on the word navy anyway. </p>

This page mentions that the EUNAVFOR Aspides coordinated the search and rescue operation. Now, I wanted to find the commander of this force. After a quick Google, I found the Rear Admiral Vasileios Gryparis, but I wasn't satisfied with my verification that he actually had something to do with the incident. </p>

This means that he was commander of EUNAVFOR when the incident happened in October. A quick verification shows indeed that <b>Andrea Quondamatteo</b> was in command of the support operation for the Falcon on October 18, 2025. </p>
