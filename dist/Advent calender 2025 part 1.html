                            <p>OSINT for Fun has a great number of challenges on their website. Each challenge is usually faster to complete than the Bellingcat ones, so that's why I do multiple at a time.<br> As I was on holiday in December, now is the time to complete the advent calendar.</p>
                            <p>Now, the first 4 days are shown, as these took me about an hour to complete in total.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h1>Day 1</h1>
                            <h2>The racecar challenge</h2>
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Racecar.png" alt="Description of the first part of the challenge" class="img-fluid"/>
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1: Description of the first part of the challenge.</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            <p>The challenge is quite straightforward: we are provided with an image of a racecar, and we need to figure out who is the driver. The obvious first thing to do is to use Google images to reverse-image search the provided photo. We find an exact image that is uploaded to Wikipedia.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Racecar-Wikipedia.png" alt="The picture as shown on Wikipedia" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2: Wikipedia page of the racecar, identical to the one provided in the challenge.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>The Wikipedia page provides us with the driver's name: "Fernando Alonso", as shown a bit further down.</p>
                            <h2>What was his best result that year?</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Which circuit question.png" alt="The question about the best result" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3: The question about the best result.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>Next, we were asked which circuit his best result was. The Wikipedia page we pulled up earlier mentioned that the image was taken in 2001. Thus, the more detailed question becomes: "In 2001, where did Fernando Alonso have his best result?"</p>
                            <p>I decided to Google this, by typing in the following: "best result alsonso [sic] 2001 season". The first hit was the Fandom page of the 2001 season of Alonso, which I deemed to be perfect for the task at hand.</p>
                            <p>The Fandom page showed all his race results in the 2001 season, and from there it was simply seeing at which GP he had his best result. This turned out to be the German GP. Control+F helped me here, but I still checked all the results, just to be sure.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Best result.png" alt="The best result of Alonso in 2001" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>He was tenth in the German GP, which was driven around the Hockenheimring, according to the Wikipedia page on the 2001 German GP. And yes, this is the right answer!</p>
                            <h2>The average speed question</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Question average speed.png" alt="The question about the average speed" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Finally, we are asked what the average speed of the race that Fernando Alonso won was. First, we need to know in what year Alonso won the next time at Hockenheim. This was found by going to all the winners of the German GP on Wikipedia and searching for his name.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Winners German GP.png" alt="Winners of the German GP" class="img-fluid">

                            </figure>
                            <p>It turns out, Alonso won in 2005, and that in 2005 the German GP was still held at the Hockenheimring. The page on that specific GP shows us the time Alonso took to finish, namely 1:26:28.599. The race distance is listed as 306.458 kilometers.</p>
                            <p>Because I'm lazy, I asked the AI to calculate the average speed for me:</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/average speed.png" alt="The average speed calculated by Google Gemini" class="img-fluid">

                            <p>Entering the answer, 212.629 km/h, completes this puzzle!</p>

                            <h1>Day 2</h1>
                            <h2>Fox Project</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>This challenge was more challenging than the first, but it only consisted of the one question visible in figure 8.</p>
                            <p>What we see is a picture with a ceiling with a bunch of flags. My hunch is that if we find that location, we can figure out who was there and find a clue about the chandelier. As such, I looked at the image a bit more closely, but I saw no definite hint. So, I resorted to reverse-searching the image, using Google.</p>
                            <p>Turns out, that when you take the whole image, Google will display numerous rooms with flags on the ceiling. Not that useful. Usually, when zooming in on a more unique part of the picture, better results come up in these cases. And that's exactly what I did.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>This worked quite well. I quickly saw that a Frenchman posted an image in the "Bagdad Cafe", which matched perfectly.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/flags which are signed and french text.png" alt="useful search result" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>I quickly saw that the Bagdad Cafe was indeed the right cafe, but that this particular gentleman did not provide any more clues. Instead, what I did was to go to the Instagram page of the cafe, filter by "recent", and look at relevant posts made in August.</p>
                            <p>Why French? I happen to know that OSINT For Fun is a French website, and that many of their challenges are originally French.</p>
                            <p>Here is where I got a bit unlucky, and where I misunderstood the assignment. I did find an Instagram post that was made in August by a French girl, which also showed the chandelier. The French girl is named Elodie, and the item on the chandelier was clearly a hat. This was all visible in the <i>videos</i> she made - which is clearly wrong as the original posts talks about photos.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/chandelier with the green and red object.png" alt="Instagram post of Elodie showing the chandelier with a hat" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 11: Instagram post of Elodie showing the chandelier with a hat. The image is a still of the video.</figcaption> 
                            </figure>
                            <p>I filled in "Elodie hat", but this was wrong.</p>
                            <p>Then I got thinking: the challenge describes someone who is sharing her thoughts. This could be a review! And where do people leave reviews, together with pictures? TripAdvisor, and Google Maps.</p>
                            <p>My gut feeling told me the review was probably posted on Google Maps, but I first checked out TripAdvisor anyway. TripAdvisor was indeed not helpful.</p>
                            <p>Next, I went to Google Maps, found the Bagdad Cafe, sorted the reviews by most recent, and scrolled down. There were quite a number of reviews, but most of them didn't have pictures.</p>
                            <p>A woman called Florence posted a review in early August. The review mentioned she was part of a group and originally the post was written in French. I thought <i>this could be it</i>. However, filling in "Florence hat" was wrong again, to my surprise.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/Florence Google review.png" alt="Google Maps review of Florence" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Following this disappointment, I decided to look through more reviews, but this time to see one where the hat was clearly visible. I first thought that the two questions (who, and what) were unrelated, but it could have been the case that the author wanted me to find a post that showed both who and the what.</p>
                            <p>I found another review, this time by a person called Denise. She also posted a clear picture of the chandelier. Note that she also originally wrote the review in French.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>As can be seen in Figure 14, the challenge is easy. Locate where the Street View image is taken, navigate to the same location on Google Maps, and see who's waiting for us on the road.</p>
                            <p>We can see a sign on the left-side of the image. Zooming in, we can see that it says "The Leather Bottle".</p>

It's clear that the pub is located in Kent, England. Next, we enter into Google Maps "leather bottle pub kent". That leads us exactly to the pub!</p>
                            <p>Now, we want to use Google Street View. However, the newest Street View imagery is from a different year, so we need to adjust this to November 2022.</p>

                        <h1>Day 4</h1>
                        <h2>Op een onbewoond eiland 🎵</h2>

                            <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/4/question 1.png" alt="Description of day 4" class="img-fluid"/>

                        <p>Lastly, we look for a movie title. We get coordinates, and we need to figure it out from there.</p>
                        <p>The first step is to open Google Maps and see where the coordinates are leading to. Turns out, they lead to an island part of Svalbard called Amsterdamøya.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>My next step was to Google "Amsterdamoya". This led to the Wikipedia page of Amsterdam Island. Here, we learn that there was a Dutch settlement called Smeerenburg, which itself has a Wikipedia page too.</p>

                        <p>On the page of Smeerenburg, under the section Myth, we can see that the animated film "Klaus" is related to this former settlement.
