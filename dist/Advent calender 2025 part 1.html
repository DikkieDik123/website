                            <subheading>Spoiler alert: solution ahead</subheading>
                            <p>OSINT for Fun has a great number of challenges on their website. Each challenge is usually faster to complete than the Bellingcat ones, so that's why I do multiple at a time.<br> As I was on holiday in December, now is the time to complete the advent calendar.</p>
                            <p>Now, the first 4 days are shown, as these took me about an hour to complete in total.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- challenge description-->
                        <div>
                            <h1>Day 1</h1>
                            <h2>The racecar challenge</h2>
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Racecar.png" alt="Description of the first part of the challenge" class="img-fluid"/>
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1: Description of the first part of the challenge</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            <p>The challenge is quite straightforward: we are provided with an image of a racecar and we need to figure out who is the driver. The obvious first thing to do is to use Google images to reverse-image search the provided photo. We find an exact image that is uploaded to Wikipedia.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Racecar-Wikipedia.png" alt="The picture as shown on Wikipedia" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2: Wikipedia page of the racecar, identical to the one provided in the challenge</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>The Wikipedia page provides us with the driver's name: "Fernando Alonso", as shown a bit further down.</p>
                            <h2>What was his best result that year?</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Which circuit question.png" alt="The question about the best result" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3: The question about the best result</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>Next, we are asked which circuit his best result was. The Wikipedia page we pulled up earlier mentioned that the image was taken in 2001. Thus, the more detailed question becomes: "In 2001, Where did Fernando Alonso have his best result?"</p>
                            <p>I decided to Google this, by typing in the following: "best result alsonso [sic] 2001 season". The first hit was the Fandom page of the 2001 season of Alonso, which I deemed to be perfect for the task at hand.</p>
                            <p>The Fandom page showed all his race results in the 2001 season, and from there it was simply seeing at which GP he had his best result. This turned out to be the German GP. Control+F helped me here, but I still checked all the results, just to be sure.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Best result.png" alt="The best result of Alonso in 2001" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 4: The best result of Alonso in 2001</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>He was tenth in the German GP, which was driven around the Hockenheimring, according to the Wikipedia page on the 2001 German GP. And yes, this is the right answer!</p>
                            <h2>The average speed question</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Question average speed.png" alt="The question about the average speed" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Finally, we are asked what was the average speed of the race that Fernando Alonso won. First, we need to know in what year Alonso won the next time at Hockenheim. This was found by going to all the winners of the German GP on Wikipedia, and searching for his name.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/Winners German GP.png" alt="Winners of the German GP" class="img-fluid">
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 6: List of Winners of the German GP. Notice that Alonso won in 2005.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>It turns out, Alonso won in 2005, and that in 2005 the German GP was still held at the Hockenheimring. The page on that specific GP shows us the time Alonso took to finish, namely 1:26:28.599. The race distance is listed as 306.458 kilometers.</p>
                            <p>Because I'm lazy, I asked the AI to calculate the average speed for me:</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/1/average speed.png" alt="The average speed calculated by Google Gemini" class="img-fluid">

                            </figure>
                            <p>Finally, entering the answer, 212.629 km/h, completes this puzzle!</p>

                            <h1>Day 2</h1>
                            <h2>Fox Project</h2>
                            <figure class="figure">

                            <p>This challenge was more challenging than the first, but it only consisted out of the one question visible in figure 8.</p>
                            <p>What we see is a picture with a ceiling with a bunch of flags. My hunch is that if we find that location, we can figure out who was there and find an clue about the chandelier. As such, I looked at the image a bit more closely, but I saw no definite hint. So, I resorted to revere-searching the image, using Google.</p>
                            <p>Turns out, that when you take the whole image, Google will display numerous rooms with flags on the ceiling. Not that useful. Usually, when zooming in on a more unique part of the picture, better results come up in these cases. And that's exactly what I did.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/Exact piece i reverse searched.png" alt="Exact piece of the image that I used to reverse search" class="img-fluid"/>

                            <p>This worked quite well. I quickly saw that a frenchman posted an image in the "Bagdad cafe", which matched perfectly.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/flags which are signed and french text.png" alt="useful rearch result" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 10: A French instagram post, showing the Bagdad Cafe, matching the source image.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>I quickly saw that the Bagdad Cafe indeed was the right cafe, but that this particular gentlemen did not provide any more clues. Instead, what I did, was to go to the instagram page of the cafe, filter by "recent", and looked at relevant posts made in August.</p>
                            <p>Why French? I happen to know that OSINT For Fun is a French website, and that many of their challenges are originally French.</p>
                            <p>Here is where I got a bit unlucky, and where I misunderstood the assignment. I did find a instagram post that was made in August by a French girl, which also showed the chandelier. The French girl is named Elodie, and the item on the chandelier was cleary a hat. This all was visible in the <i>video's</i> she made - which is clearly wrong as the original posts talks about photo's.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/chandelier with the green and red object.png" alt="Instagram post of Elodie showing the chandelier with a hat" class="img-fluid"/>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 11: Instagram post of Elodie showing the chandelier with a hat. The image is a still of the video.</figcaption> 
                            </figure>
                            <p>I filled in "Elodie hat", but this was wrong.</p>
                            <p>Then I got thinking: the challenge describes someone who is sharing her thoughts. This could be a review! And where do people leave reviews, together with pictures? Tripadvisor, and Google Maps.</p>
                            <p>My gut feeling told me the review was probably posted on Google Maps, but I first checked out Tripadvisor anyway. Tripadvisor was indeed not helpful.</p>
                            <p>Next, I went to Google maps, found the Bagdad Cafe, sorted the reviews by most recent, and scrolled down. There were quite a number of reviews, but most of them didn't have pictures.</p>
                            <p>A woman called Florence posted a review in early August. The review mentioned she was part of a group and originally the post was written in French. I thought: this could be it. However, filling in "Florence hat" was wrong again, to my suprise.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/2/Florence Google review.png" alt="Google Maps review of Florence" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Following this dissapointment, I decided to look through more reviews, but this time to see one where the hat was clearly visible. I first thought that the two questions (who, and what) were unrelated, but it could have been the case that the author wanted me to find a post that showed both who and the what.</p>
