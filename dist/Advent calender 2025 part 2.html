                            <p>OSINT for Fun has a great number of challenges on their website. Each challenge is usually faster to complete than the Bellingcat ones, so that's why I do multiple at a time.<br> As I was on holiday in December, now is the time to complete the advent calendar.</p>
                            <p>This post, I'm going to show how I solved the challenges of day 5 till 8.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- challenge description-->
                        <div>
                            <h1>Day 5</h1>
                            <h2>When in doubt, dork it out!</h2>
                            <p><figure class="figure">

                            This challenge seems easy. Find two decrees that are listed on Wordpress websites that belong to municipalities, which decree that the Grinch is not welcome.</p>
                            <p>However, I made this challenge way too hard for myself, which unfortunately sometimes happens.</p>
                            <p>I knew I had to dork my way through this challenge. What I assumed, however, is that the decree would stipulate that ANY "bad" character that might hinder Santa from doing its job would be banned.</p>
                            <p>My second mistake was that I assumed that the website would be hosted for free, on Wordpress.com. And if not, I assumed that the website would have the word "wordpress" in there, which wasn't the case in the end.</p>
                            <p>Long story short, I figured out that I could not find the documents via site:wordpress.com. I also found that using the operator "Wordpress" wasn't completely sufficient, as I could only find one of the two decrees this way.</p>
                            <p>Because I used a little bit of Wordpress in the past, I know that the standard configuration to save documents is to store them into wp-content. However, I realized this late. But it turned out to be the key to solving the riddle.</p>
                            <p>This is the dork that I finally used to complete the challenge: <b>"arrêté" AND "Grinch" AND "wp-content"</b>. And that led me to see the following: 
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/5/Google results.png" alt="Result of the dork" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </p>
                            <p>From there, I saw that there were two results which are relevant because they are from 2024. And as a bonus I found another blog doing the exact same thing, which is annoying but hey, at least I know that I'm on the right track.</p>
                            <p>After downloading the PDFs and translating them using my phone, I concluded that these decrees are what I was looking for, and I noted down the surnames of the mayors: <b>Dupuy and Driol</b>. Et voila, challenge completed!</p>

                            <p>This "inspiring" video is posted on LinkedIn, which I have an account for, as you might have guessed from my website already. My first action was playing the video. There is a boy catching two big fishes using a funny device. Not too inspiring, if you ask me, but hey, good for him.</p>
                            <p>I want to get an image of the video, so I can try to reverse-search this. So, what I did, is go to the HTML-viewer of Firefox to seek out the image that is used as the thumbnail. If you don't understand, take a close look at the next figure. You can see the code of the page next to the image, and there is a link to the thumbnail of the video: 
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/6/HTML.png" alt="Image showing the video next to the HTML-viewer to see the source code of the image" class="img-fluid"/>

                                </figure>
                                <br> I opened the image in the browser, and then I used my plugin to reverse-search the image on Google.
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/6/Reverse Image Search.png" alt="Reverse image search of the thumbnail" class="img-fluid"/>
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 5: Reverse image search is used to find more information</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </p>
                            <p>There were many results. First, I clicked on "About this image". Google was so kind to show me that similar images are at least 3 years old, meaning that the first result was probably not older than 5 years, or Google might have known it. I'm still not trusting Google completely, but it gives me a good indication.
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/6/About this image.png" alt="About this image" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </p>
                            <p>Next, I went to the tab "Visual Matches". I want to find an exact match of the image, and I thought this page could help me. The other pages of Google showed that a lot of people reposted the same video, and I didn't feel like going through them to see which one was the oldest.</p>
                            <p>Luckily for me, a news article mentions is linked to this exact video:
                                <figure class="figure">

                            </p>
                            <p>The article talks about the video being posted by a billionaire on Twitter, on April 1st. I'm guessing that this person is considered an influencer, because there are news-outlets writing about this.   
                                <figure class="figure">

                            <p>We now know the name: <b>Anand Mahindra</b>. Recognizable name, as Mahindra is a huge company that also makes cars. It was indeed this man who made the video go viral!</p>

                            <h2>Sounds good to me!</h2>
                            <h3>7.1</h3>
                            <p>This challenge is a chain of shorter ones, as it consists of multiple parts. The first question relates to the surnames of people who are being thanked in the recording which is shown. Should not be too difficult.</p>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/7/Question.png" alt="Question of day 7" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>First, I wanted to find a recording of the record. I did this by reverse-image searching the image on screen and learning that the record is called "The Beatles Christmas Record".</p>
                            <p>Entering "The Beatles Christmas Record recording" into Google led me to a <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55a4om">Dailymotion page</a>. Listening to the recording, I could clearly hear that man in the recording is thanking the secretaries for all the work. However, I could not clearly hear the names of the secretaries.</p>
                            <p>So, I did some Googling. I found very quickly that one of the secretaries mentioned must refer to the secretary of the fan club of the Beatles, called <b>Freda Kelly</b>. And soon that the other secretaries were <b>Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose</b>, even though these people are fictitious. Still, it matched the recording!</p>
                            <p><figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/7/Clues.png" alt="A website mentioning the names of the fictitious other secretaries" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            So, the answer to the first part of the question is: <b>Kelly Collingham Rose</b>.</p>
                            <h3>7.2</h3>
                            <figure class="figure">
                                <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/7/Next Question.png" alt="Second question of the challenge" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Question: Find an envelope sent to Kelly back when she first started the fan club and find its origin. Again, it doesn't seem too difficult.</p>
                            <p>I started to google "Freda Kelly documentary" and I found a trailer to the documentary. The first video result is a YouTube video, which shows an envelope in the shot.</p>
                            <p>Using the comma and dot keys to stop the video on a specific frame, I saw that the letter had a stamp saying "galati tranzit". 
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/7/Frame with the stamp.png" alt="Frame where you can see the stamp on the letter in the trailer of the documentary on YouTube." class="img-fluid"/>
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 12: Frame where you can see the stamp on the letter in the trailer of the documentary on YouTube.</figcaption>

                            </p>
                            <p>The stamp is usally the originating city of the sender, so I Googled: "galati tranzit". The results show point to Galati, a city in Romania.
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/7/Romania.png" alt="Google search results for galati tranzit" class="img-fluid"/>

                            <p>Filling in Galati Romania is the right answer - onto the last part of the challenge!</p>
                            <h3>7.3</h3>

                            <p>I went back to Wikipedia to find the title of the 1965 flexi disk. Very originally, they called it "The Beatles Third Christmas Record".</p>
                            <p>Next, I did something radical. I googled "third Christmas record museum" and went to the first hit.</p>

                            <p>The quest is relatively simple: find the movie which was illegally shot in the location as seen in Figure 17. And as has become almost standard now, I reverse-search the image provided.</p>
                            <p>Google is kind enough to show that this image is shot in Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann, which is located in the center of Paris in the 9th arrondissement.
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/8/Galerie.png" alt="Google AI showing information about the provided image" class="img-fluid"/>

                                </figure>
                            </p>
                            <p>Next, I needed to see what movie was illegally shot in the Galeries Lafayette. This involved some Googling, and I didn't get the answer immediately. First, I found a bunch of movies which were legally shot in the Galerie, and I also stumbled across the movie C'était un Rendez-vous (1976). This particular movie was not the right answer as it had nothing to do with the Galerie, but it's a really cool piece of film and I recommend everyone to see it.</p>
                            <p>Anyway, when in doubt, dork it out. So I did, using the following entry:<b>"Galeries Lafayette" AND "movie" AND "illegal"</b>.
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/8/Dork.png" alt="Dork results for Galeries Lafayette AND movie AND illegal" class="img-fluid"/>
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 19: "Galeries Lafayette" AND "movie" AND "illegal".</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                This led to a IMDb page which had a comment, saying that Le père Noël est une ordure was partially filmed illegally at the department store. In fact, the police arrested one of the crew, something to do with wearing a Santa suit when it's not allowed.  
                            </p>
                            <p>To figure out when this movie was made I started to read its Wikipedia page and the IMDb pages. This led me to believe that the movie was made in 1982, but it doesn't state which months the movie was produced, or when the crewmember was arrested. So, more Googling was needed.</p>
                            <p>After reading a bunch of more websites, all in French, about the movies, I was no wiser. So I decided to once again dork my way out of the problem. First, I translated the word for "shooting" or "filming" to French (tournage). Then, I simply created the following dork: "Le pere Noel est une ordure" AND "tournage".
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/8/The second dork.png" alt="Doogle Dork Le pere Noel est une ordure AND tournage" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </p>
                            <p>Et voila, the second hit on the page is a French blogpost about the making of this movie. 
                                <figure class="figure">
                                    <img src="assets/img/OSINT for fun advent calendar/8/The answer.png" alt="Screenshot of the French blogpost which shows when the shot in the Galerie Lafayette was made" class="img-fluid"/>

                            </p>
                            <p>So, we learn that the bit in Galeries Layafette was shot in <b>December 1981</b>. This concludes this challenge, and this blogpost. Hope you liked it!</p>
